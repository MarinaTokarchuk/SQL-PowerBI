# SQL-PowerBI
Developing a Database to analyze&amp;visualize Hotels Booking Data

The main questions in this project:
- Is our hotel revenue growing by year? - we have two types of hotels so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type
- Should we increase our parking lot size? - we want to understand  if there is a ternd is guest with personal cars
- What trends can we see in the data? - focus on average daily rate and quests to explore seasonality


My steps in this project:
1. Build a Database
2. Analyze and Retrieve Data with SQL
3. Connect Power BI to a Database
4. Visualize Data in Power BI
